        Move dependence on Test::More from PREREQ_PM to BUILD_REQUIRES
        and add IPC::Run to BUILD_REQUIRES (this rather defeats the
        purpose of falling back to Net::OpenSSH for a local target VM
        when IPC::Run is missing; but in the absence of any way to

        it seems the best compromise, since IPC::Run is far more commonly
        found than Net::OpenSSH).
