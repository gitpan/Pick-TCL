Revision history for Pick-TCL

0.06    2014-07-06
        Add option for the caller to specify a timeout at object
        instantiation time (only when Pick is remote).

0.05    2014-05-03
        Add methods for asynchronous execution (spawn, is_ready, output,
        outputraw, partialoutput, partialoutputraw)

0.04    2014-01-06
        Update dependencies in Makefile.PL.
        Add fallback to getlogin() for systems without a working getpwuid()
        for defaulting USER when neither USER nor SSHUSER is specified.

0.03    2014-01-05
        Move dependence on Test::More from PREREQ_PM to BUILD_REQUIRES
        and add IPC::Run to BUILD_REQUIRES (this rather defeats the
        purpose of falling back to Net::OpenSSH for a local target VM
        when IPC::Run is missing; but in the absence of any way to
        define an OR relationship between modules listed in BUILD_REQUIRES
        it seems the best compromise, since IPC::Run is far more commonly
        found than Net::OpenSSH).

0.02    2014-01-05
        Bugfix: Pick::TCL now parses cleanly when IPC::Run in missing

0.01    2014-01-02
        First public release.
